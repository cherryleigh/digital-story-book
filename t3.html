<p>Without a word, the Ani-ani stepped back and shifted once more, becoming the same black dog Tomas had seen earlier. It walked toward the trees, glancing back only once, silently commanding him to follow. As Tomas obeyed, the forest slowly returned to normal, with insects singing and moonlight breaking through the canopy. Before long, he found himself at the edge of the woods, facing the familiar fields of his village. The dog stood at the boundary, its form shimmering before fading into the shadows. Tomas fell to the ground in relief, whispering his thanks to the unseen spirit. From that day on, he never entered the forest without respect, and he taught others to do the same. Crops on his land began to flourish, and he never again lost an animal to the woods. Villagers noticed that the forest near his farm seemed calmer, almost protective. Some claimed to see a black dog watching from afar whenever Tomas passed by. Whether real or imagined, the Ani-ani had marked him as one who learned the lesson of humility. The story of his encounter spread through the village, reminding all who heard it that the land is alive and always watching.</p>
