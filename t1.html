<p>At the edge of a quiet Visayan village, there was a stretch of forest that the elders warned people not to disturb, for they believed an Ani-ani lived among its trees. One evening, a young farmer named Tomas ignored these warnings as he chased a stray pig that had wandered into the woods. As he walked deeper inside, the forest grew unnaturally silent, and even the insects stopped singing. Tomas soon noticed a small black dog following him, always keeping a careful distance. Whenever he stopped, the dog stopped as well, watching him with eyes that reflected too much light. Thinking it belonged to someone else, Tomas continued walking, unaware that the path behind him was slowly changing. Trees seemed to shift, and familiar landmarks disappeared. The air felt heavy, as if the forest itself was breathing. A sudden chill ran through him, and he remembered the stories of the Ani-ani, spirits that watched humans through borrowed animal forms. He tried to laugh it off, but his footsteps began to echo strangely, and the dog vanished without a sound.</p>
