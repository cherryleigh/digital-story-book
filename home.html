<h2 align="center">The Tale of Ani-Ani</h2>

  <div>
    <p>The Ani-ani is a mythical creature from Philippine folklore, most commonly associated with Visayan traditions. It is known as a shapeshifting nature spirit rather than a monster. The Ani-ani has no permanent physical form. It can transform itself into various animals found in rural environments. Common animal forms include dogs, cats, pigs, birds, and other small creatures. These animals often appear ordinary at first glance. Subtle details, however, may feel unnatural or unsettling. Its eyes may linger too long or reflect light strangely. The creature usually chooses forms that allow it to observe humans unnoticed. In rare accounts, the Ani-ani reveals a true form resembling a small humanoid being. This form is often described as child-sized. Its features are said to be vaguely human but distorted. Witnesses describe an eerie stillness when it appears. The Ani-ani is closely tied to forests, fields, and untamed land. It is believed to dwell near farms, paths, and wilderness edges. The creature emerges mostly at night or during quiet hours. It avoids crowded places and loud gatherings. Many stories describe it appearing to lone travelers. It may follow a person without making a sound. People often sense its presence before seeing it. The air may feel heavy or unusually silent. Animals nearby may suddenly stop moving. Despite its frightening aura, the Ani-ani is not inherently evil. It exists as part of the spirit-filled natural world. Its presence reminds humans that nature is never truly empty.</p>
