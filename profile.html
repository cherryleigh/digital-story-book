  <h1>AUTHOR</h1>

  <div>
  <p>My name is Jhiliane Leigh Tagupa, and I am a student who loves reading and writing. I enjoy discovering new stories and ideas through books, and I often express my thoughts, feelings, and creativity through my own writing.</p>

  <p>As a learner, I am curious and imaginative, and reading and writing help me grow both academically and personally. These interests allow me to expand my knowledge, improve my skills, and better understand the world around me.</p>
