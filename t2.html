<p>As darkness fell, Tomas realized he was lost, even though he had walked these woods since childhood. A bird with dark feathers landed on a branch above him, tilting its head in a way that felt too deliberate. When Tomas moved, the bird followed, hopping from tree to tree, always guiding him forward. Desperate, he followed it, believing it might lead him out. Instead, the forest grew denser, and shadows twisted into unfamiliar shapes. Tomas stumbled upon a clearing where the bird suddenly transformed into a small humanoid figure, no taller than a child. Its face was neither kind nor cruel, but ancient and watchful. Tomas fell to his knees, realizing he stood before the Ani-ani. Trembling, he apologized for trespassing and promised never to harm the forest again. The creature circled him silently, its footsteps making no sound on the leaves. The wind rose, carrying whispers that felt like judgment. For a moment, Tomas feared he would never leave the forest alive. Then the Ani-ani paused, studying his bowed head, as if weighing his sincerity.</p>
